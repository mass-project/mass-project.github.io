About MASS
----------
The Malware Analysis and Storage System (MASS) provides a distributed and scalable architecture to analyze malware samples. The MASS server contains a database of all submitted malware samples and all the gathered analysis data. Analysis systems are connected to the MASS server and automatically receive new samples in order to execute an analysis. Researchers can obtain the analysis results via the MASS web interface or the REST API.

The goal of our project is to create a flexible and reusable platform for malware analysis which empowers collaboration between malware researchers. MASS is free and open source software licensed under the terms of the MIT license. Other researchers are invited to contribute to the MASS development!

Developer team
--------------
The Malware Analysis and Storage System (MASS) is a joint research project by the Communication and Network Systems Group @ University of Bonn and the Fraunhofer FKIE.
